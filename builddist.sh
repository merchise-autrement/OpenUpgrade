# Build OpenERP 7.0 and 8.0 sdists.
#
# You MUST place this in the root of your odoo repository.  It expects you
# have the local branches 7.0 and any other you may use.
#
# Usage:
#
#    ./builddist.sh [--pep440] [BRANCH] [VERSION]
#
# The default for BRANCH is "7.0".  If BRANCH is set but VERSION is not, it
# defaults to the part of BRANCH after the first "-" which starts with a
# digit.
