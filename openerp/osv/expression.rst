.. warning:: About the accuracy of these notes.

   These note are about learning.  I need to write stuff while I'm
   learning, it let's me to fix it on my head.  At the same time, I
   believe, these notes will serve anyone (including myself)
   needing to change and/or debug the server.

   These notes may contain errors and other inaccuracies.  To the
   best of my effort I will keep them at a minimum, but they only
   show my learning process.

   You are entitled to correct me publicly.
